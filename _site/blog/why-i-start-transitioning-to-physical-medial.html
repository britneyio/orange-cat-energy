A Netflix household used to be anyone using that account information. A Netflix household is now users using a Netflix account under the same Wi-Fi. I am no longer under the same Wi-Fi for most of the accounts that I hold. Once, I started realizing the services that I use, the costs started adding up. Let’s say Netflix, Hulu, Disney, Max, and Spotify:</p><p>Netflix (no ads) - $15.49</p><p>Disney, Hulu, Max (no ads) - $ 30.49</p><p>Spotify (no ads) - $11.99</p><p>= $57.47</p><p>Not even including the Peacock, DirectTV, Paramount Plus, Amazon Prime, and probably more that I don’t know about. Everything is trying to be a subscription service these days.</p><p>I like to spend my money on food and experiences. I could buy 4 CAVA bowls or go see two movies in theatres.</p><h3 id="2--why-pay-for-a-subscription-when-it-is-not-guaranteed-to-have-your-favorite-content-forever">2. <strong>Why pay for a subscription when it is not guaranteed to have your favorite content forever?</strong></h3><p>Losses:</p><ul><li><p>Community (Netflix)</p><li><p>The Office (Netflix)</p><li><p>Shark Boy and Lava Girl (Netflix)</p><li><p>Futurama (Netflix)</p></ul><p>Maybe this is a Netflix problem, or maybe I mostly use Netflix, but I’ve also seen this happen on Spotify as well.</p><p>My most recent example is Dumb by The Hey Daze on Spotify, not disappearing but greyed out in my playlist. And on one of my biggest playlists, I noticed I lost a few more songs. There are multitude of reasons this happens: music license expiring, an artist revoking their music from the platform, songs banned/restricted in some places, etc.</p><p>While I am discounting these platforms, that have produced some of my favorite pieces of media:</p><ul><li><p>Bridgerton (Queen Charlotte)</p><li><p>BoJack Horsemen</p><li><p>Ultimatum</p><li><p>Arcane</p><li><p>and more</p></ul><p>These are some of amazing shows they have created and that they deserve the credit for them. Some of these shows I will shell out for some DVDs, and others I would not. As time goes on though, for every good show they create, they create 10-20 bad ones that create a lot noise resulting in an unusable and useless platform.</p><h3 id="3--i-dont-want-to-rely-on-other-platforms-that-may-die-and-take-my-data-with-it">3. <strong>I don’t want to rely on other platforms that may die and take my data with it.</strong></h3><p>A few examples:</p><p>MySpace</p><p>Vine</p><p>If you didn’t save everything on your own computer, everything that you posted will have been lost. Even if you saved every photo and song you had on MySpace, the special profile that you created is now lost.</p><h3 id="4--privacy-concerns">4. <strong>Privacy concerns</strong></h3><p>All of our data is sold to other companies.</p><h3 id="5--the-real-reason--im-addicted">5. <strong>The real reason – I’m addicted.</strong></h3><p>I have the attention span that is between a puppy and a goldfish. No matter how bad I know watching short term content is, my brain frigging loves it. Surprisingly though, I deleted TikTok a few years ago, and haven’t really craved it again.</p><p><a href="">Reddit</a></p><p>I know most people’s problem app is scrolling Instagram. Mine is reddit. I can read, create, and interact in my niche computer related communities. I think it’s useful for a very minute amount of questions. For every 5% useful, the 95% is junk. Which makes it just as much a time sunk as Instagram. It’s more useful if I just never use it, as I gain time in my day. Blogs and YouTube usually have better, and more in depth explanations and reviews.</p><p><a href="">Instagram</a></p><p>If I do end up opening Instagram, can be another time sunk now that they added Reels. I’ve just added a blocker for reels though.</p><p><a href="">YouTube</a></p><p>YouTube shorts. Installed a blocker for that as well. Even with the long term content, it is still a major time sunk though. If I replaced the amount of YouTube I watch with something productive. I would actually produce things—like this blog post!</p><p><a href="">Streaming Services</a></p><p>Major binge watch sessions may occur. These can disrupt my life. Do I study or do I watch the new season?</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>I found that physical media took more thought and more effort. Instead of convenience and boredom, I value the media itself. It allows me more separation between hobbies and entertainment. Scrolling a social media platform, or watching hours of content aren’t hobbies, they are convenient entertainment streams. Hobbies are writing this post, or building this website, or sitting down and engaging in the DVDs of the shows I truly enjoy.</p></main><footer> <a href="/orange-cat-energy/blog">← Back to all writings</a> <!--<nav class="sans"><hr> <input class="menu-btn" type="checkbox" id="menu-btn" /><p><label class="menu-icon" for="menu-btn">Menu</label></p><ul class="site-nav"><li><a href="/">Home</a><li><a href="/blog">Blog</a><li><a href="/designs">Designs</a><li><a href="/about">About</a><li><a href="https://canisee.xyz" title="Confirm your vision functionality">[Can I See]</a></ul></nav>--> <!-- <span class="mini-note">You've reached the end of the page.
